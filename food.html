        <h3>About My Favorite Food</h3>
        <p>As you can see in the picture above, my favorite food is lasagna. That's me and my friend cooking here in the United States. I am purely vegetarian, and it is difficult for me to find good food here in Madison. I generally cook for myself. This picture is from last semester; I have been in the United States since Fall 2021 and haven't gone back to India in these 2 and a half years. The only food item I missed was lasagna. So my friend and I decided to cook a vegetarian lasagna one day. It took us 3 hours to cook one dish, with 1 hour for prep time and 2 hours for the wait time after setting it into the oven. During those 2 hours, we were just praying that the results would be good. AND YES, WE DID IT!</p>
        <h3>Why I Like It</h3>
        <p>The reason I like it so much is because it's like a family dish for us. What I mean by that is when I was back at home and if my family was ever confused about what we should eat that day, we would always choose lasagna. Either my mom would make it at home for us, or we would order it from outside. That's why this dish has become special to me.</p>
