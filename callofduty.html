        <h3>About call of duty</h3>
        <p>Call of Duty Mobile is a smartphone game that lets players compete in fast-paced shooting matches against others online. It features various modes, weapons, and maps, making it exciting and fun to play. I am so involved in this game, that I have even spent money on the game and put hours into the game.</p>
        <h3>Why is it important to me</h3>
        <p>Whenever my friends and I are sitting together with nothing to do, we look at each other, no words spoken, and the next second, all of us have Call of Duty open on our phones. In the above picture, you can see me playing COD (short for Call of Duty). Whenever I am stressed, I play this game, and it helps me calm down. Before going to give any exam, I play one game before entering the examination hall.</p>
