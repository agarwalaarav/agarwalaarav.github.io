        <h3>About Basketball</h3>
        <p>Basketball is a team sport where two teams, typically of five players each, against each other on a rectangular court, compete with the primary objective of shooting a basketball through the defender's hoop while preventing the opposing team from shooting through their own hoop.</p>
        <h3>Why I Like Basketball</h3>
        <p> I started playing basketball at the age of 12, with the intention of increasing my height. I don't know how much the game affected my height, but after playing regularly for 6 months, I fell in love with it. Every morning, I would wake up at 5 and go play basketball for 3 hours before school started. I enjoy the fast-paced nature of the game, the teamwork involved, and how it improves physical fitness and coordination. It's also a great way to connect with friends and be part of a community.</p>
